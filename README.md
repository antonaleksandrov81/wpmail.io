# wpmail.io
Self-hosted Wordpress API mail gateway

Status: December 2024 - still in early development stage.

# Idea & purpose
Provide self hosted email relay solution for Wordpress.
Wordpress should connected to wpmail.io gateway through regular JSON request. WpMail.io would then decide how to relay email further. 
Solution should provide ability to log and analyze email deliverability, provide centralized historical data, ability to alter sender and use different delivery transports, according to configured settings.
